 <title>Streaming</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>A ByteString represents a single memory buffer. If we were to naively use a plain ByteString
   for holding the entire request or response bodies, our applications could never scale to large
   requests or responses. Instead, we use a technique called enumerators, very similar in concept to
   generators in Python. Our application becomes a consumer of a stream of ByteStrings representing
   the incoming request body, and a producer of a separate stream for the response.</p>
  <p>We now need to slightly revise our definition of an application. An application will take a
   request value, containing headers, query string, etc, and will consume a stream of ByteStrings,
   producing a Response. So our actual definition of an Application
   is:<codeblock>type Application = Request -> Iteratee ByteString IO Response</codeblock>The IO
   simply explains what types of side effects an application can perform. In the case of IO, it can
   perform any kind of interaction with the outside world, an obvious necessity for the vast
   majority of web applications.</p>
