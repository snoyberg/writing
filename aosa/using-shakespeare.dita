 <title>Using Shakespeare</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Shakespeare languages have three modes of running available: embedded within your Haskell
   source, stored in a separate file and compiled into the executable, or loaded from an external
   file at runtime. The last, called debug mode, is perfect for rapid development. The first two
   both allow for incredibly fast production code with minimal file dependencies. Also, it's very
   easy to switch between external file and debug mode. The default scaffolded Yesod site handles
   this with a single preprocessor variable.</p>
