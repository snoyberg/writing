 <conbody>
  <p>No amount of static typing will obviate the need for testing. We all know that automated
   testing is a necessity for any serious applications. wai-test is the recommended approach to
   testing a WAI application. Since requests and responses are simple datatypes, it's very easy to
   mock up a fake request, pass it to an application, and test properties about the response.
   wai-test simply provides some convenience functions for testing common properties like the
   presence of a header or a status code.</p>
